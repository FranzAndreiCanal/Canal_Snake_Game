# Overview

Welcome to the Snake Game, a classic arcade-style game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. This project provides a simple and enjoyable rendition of the iconic Snake Game, where players control a snake navigating a grid, consuming apples to grow longer.

# Features

## I. Snake Movement
+ Control the snake's movement using arrow keys: Up, Down, Left, and Right.
+ The snake's direction is responsive and smoothly updates based on user input.

## II. Apple Consumption
+ Apples randomly spawn on the grid for the snake to devour.
+ Upon consuming an apple, the snake's length increases, adding a layer of challenge as the game progresses.

## III. Game Over Conditions
+ The game resets if the snake collides with its own body, preventing self-intersection.
+ Boundary collisions trigger a game reset, ensuring a continuous and challenging gameplay experience.
